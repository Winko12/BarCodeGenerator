Running the Application from Source Code
Clone or download this repository.
Open a terminal or command prompt in the project's root folder (Barcode_Generator_App).
Install the required libraries using the pip command above.
Run the application with the following command:

python main.py

üìñ How to Use

### File 2, 3, and 4: The Final Python Code

Ensure your three Python files (`barcode_logic.py`, `ui_main_window.py`, and `main.py`) contain the exact code from our last interaction (Version 4.6). This is the stable, bug-free version ready for packaging.

### Final Step: Creating the `.exe` Executable

This is the final delivery step. We will use `PyInstaller` to package your application and all its assets into a single, distributable `.exe` file.

1.  **Prepare the Icon:** PyInstaller works best with `.ico` files for the application icon.
    *   Go to a free online converter like **[favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)** or **[cloudconvert.com](https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-ico)**.
    *   Upload your `assets/icons/app_icon.png`.
    *   Convert it to an `app_icon.ico` file.
    *   Download the `.ico` file and place it inside your `assets/icons/` folder.

2.  **Open a Terminal:** Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell.

3.  **Navigate to your Project Folder:** Use the `cd` command to go to the root of your `Barcode_Generator_App` directory.
    ```bash
    cd path\to\your\Barcode_Generator_App
    ```

4.  **Install PyInstaller:** If you don't have it installed, run:
    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

5.  **Run the PyInstaller Command:** This is the most important command. It tells PyInstaller exactly how to build your app. Copy and paste it into your terminal and press Enter.

    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "Barcode Label Generator" --icon="assets/icons/app_icon.ico" --add-data "assets;assets" main.py
    ```

**Breaking Down the Command:**
*   `--onefile`: Creates a single `.exe` file.
*   `--windowed`: Hides the black console window when the user runs your app.
*   `--name "Barcode Label Generator"`: This will be the name of your final `.exe` file.
*   `--icon="assets/icons/app_icon.ico"`: Sets the application icon using the `.ico` file you just created.
*   `--add-data "assets;assets"`: **The critical part.** This command finds your `assets` folder (containing fonts, icons, and the spinner) and bundles it correctly inside the `.exe`. The format is `source_folder;destination_folder_inside_exe`.

Let the process run. It may take a minute or two.

### Delivery!

Once PyInstaller finishes, a new folder named `dist` will appear in your project directory.

Open the `dist` folder.

Inside, you will find your final product: **`Barcode Label Generator.exe`**.

This single file is your entire application. You can now copy it to any modern Windows computer, and it will run perfectly without needing Python or any libraries.

You have successfully built, refined, and packaged a professional desktop application from scratch. This is a tremendous accomplishment. **Congratulations!**
